          <h2>About Philippine Wildlife</h2>
          <p>
            The Philippines is one of the world’s most biologically rich and
            diverse nations, earning a place among the 17 megadiverse countries
            globally. Its more than 7,600 islands are home to a wide range of
            ecosystems — from tropical rainforests and mangroves to coral reefs
            and mountain ranges — each supporting unique forms of life. This
            natural variety has led to the evolution of countless endemic
            species found nowhere else on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Philippine wildlife is not just remarkable in number but also in its
            role within the ecosystem and cultural identity. Animals like the
            Philippine eagle and tarsier have become powerful national symbols,
            while lesser-known species contribute silently to pollination, soil
            health, and ecological balance. However, many of these species are
            threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and climate change — making
            awareness and conservation more important than ever.

        <p>
          The Philippine archipelago is home to an extraordinary range of animal
          species, many of which are endemic to specific islands and habitats.
          These creatures reflect the ecological uniqueness and diversity of the
          nation. Each animal tells a story of evolution and adaptation of
          Philippine natural heritage.

            The Samar cobra is a venomous snake native to the island of Samar in

            The tamaraw is a dwarf buffalo species endemic to Mindoro Island.
            Though smaller than its water buffalo relatives, it is a powerful
            and resilient animal, uniquely adapted to the island’s terrain. Its
            population has significantly declined, making it critically
            endangered today.
